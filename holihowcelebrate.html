				<h3>
					According to the Hindu scriptures, Ranga Panchami is symbolic of victory over 'rajasi gun and tamasic guns, which are 
					the barrier to spiritual advancement. Rang Panchami is celebrated mainly by people living in Uttar Pradesh,	Madhya Pradesh, 
					Maharashtra and some northern Indian areas.
						<br>
					Significance: Rangapanchami is celebrated five days after Dulendi or Holi, but it is not the usual Holi colors that paint 
					the atmosphere around, rather it is the color of music that fills the air. Indore has its own style of celebrating Rang Panchami.

				<h3>
					This was where Guru Gobind Singh presented the Hola celebration in the spring of 1701, the day after Holi. Hola Mohalla conveys the 
					message of courage and defense preparation, concepts dear to the Tenth Guru, who defended the Sikhs against the threats of the Mughal
					Empire and the Hill Kings.Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji built upon this method of celebrating Holi by adding a martial element and creating 
					Hola Mohalla to be celebrated a day after Holi. The festival also has roots in the story of the child bhagat, Prahlad who would not accept 
					his father, Harnakash, as god.

					The Lathmar Holi is celebrated in memory of lord Krishna and the goddess Radha. As the legend goes, Krishna and his friends used to 
					visit Barsana from Nandgaon to play Holi. They used to spray colours and sing to Radha and Gopis. Lathmar Holi seeks to recreate that. 
					Holi gets its name from Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashyap. The ancient story of Holi states that Lord Vishnu, a 
					Hindu god, killed the demon kings younger brother. Hiranyakashyap wanted to avenge his brothers death, but also take Vishnu's power over
					heaven and the underworld.

					The festival signifies the end of winters and arrival of blooming spring. The festival also celebrates the beginning of harvest season. 
					It is celebrated on the first Full Moon of Phalguna Month according to Indian Calendar. Tagore himself was not immune to the ethereal 
					charm that is accompanied by the arrival of the	blossoms of spring and the bright colours of the season. In the 1920s, he decided to celebrate 
					the arrival of spring during Basant Panchami. For this is the land of Santiniketan, where Holi or Dol is celebrated as Basanta Utsav, 
					where nature and human amalgamate into a rare union.
