				In ancient time, Hiranyakashipu was a very powerful king of Ahuras. It is considered that his brother was killed by Lord Vishnu. In order to take revange of that, 
				he prayed hard of God and gained boon that, He will neither be killed by human nor by animal, He will neither be killed on earth nor in water or sky, He will neither 
				be killed be killed in day time nor in night time, He will neither be kille indoor not outdoor, He will neither be killed by Astra nor by Sastra. 
					<br>				
					<br>				
				By gaining this boon and many other powers, he start considering himself invincible and became too arogant that start punushing whosoever didn't agreed to pray him as 
				as God. But his own son, Prahalad, denied accepting him as God and start praying Lord Vishnu. After knowing this, king decided to kill his own son with the help of his 
				sister named Holika. As Holika conisdered immune to fire, she sat in fire with having Prahalad in her lap. WIth the God's grace, her immunity got transferred to Prahalad 
				and she burnt to ashes. Immediately after that, Lord Vishnu appeared in form of Narsimha (half human and half lion), during evening time, took Hiranyakashipu at doorstep 
				and killed him with his nail by placing him on his lap. 
					<br>
					<br>				
				Since than, that day is celebrated as a symbol of victory of good over evil.
