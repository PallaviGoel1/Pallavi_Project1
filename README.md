# Holi Project

Welcome: [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

Project Description: 

As I am studying at Code Institute, this project is prepared for submission as my first project after getting a good understanding of HTML and CSS.

This project is the place for information related to one of the most popular Indian festivals, Holi. Here I try to add all relevant information related to this festival for example,what this festival is, why it is celebrated, how one can celebrate it, what preparations are required, where one can join others in this celebration, etc. 

I, myself, struggled many times to get the complete understanding of this festival and needed to Google multiple websites to get all the information. 
So this thought triggered in my mind the desire to create a one stop place for such information and to prepare this website. On this website, I used information 
from various places, including public websites, religious books and as well self-knowledge.

# How to use: 

This is an information website; hence, no specific instructions are required here for usage. The information on this website is quite self-explanatory. On the events page,it is currently displaying a dummy list of events. In the future,we will add an option to filter that out based on search criteria, so
 that the user can filter out a list of events based on his or her current location.

# Roadmap:

Currently,this website is for internal use and is limited to HTML and CSS as technologies. In the future,we would like to enhance this as follows:
- Update information on Preparations page, as food is just one part of preparation, though it is most important.
- Upgrade site for search criteria with the events filtering.
- Add section for live feedback/inputs/suggestions from users.
- Add registration/login possibilities for users from around the world to contribute here
- Add functionality to send event information to registered users.
- Cater the event registration process through this website for events around the world.

# Acknowledgement:

I took help from training material provided by the Code Institute when preparing this website. Along with that, big community of developers from the Code Institute and my mentor were very helpful in supporting me time to time during the development phase.

# Project Status:

In its current status, this website is functioning for the targeted local execution. As well, this is ready for launch on the WWW. High-level enhancements for fututre are metioned in the roadmap, which are not mandatory, of course, but will provide more value to the website.
