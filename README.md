# Holi - The festival of colors

This website is the place for information related to one of the most popular Indian festivals, Holi. Here I try to add all relevant information related to this festival for example, what this festival is, why it is celebrated, how one can celebrate it, what preparations are required, where one can join others in this celebration, etc. 

One can find most of the information related to this festival by visiting various websites. But couldn't find a single website which can provide complete information related to this at one place. So thought to create a one stop place for such information to make it easier for anyone who is intersted in it. On this website, I used information from various places, including public websites, religious books and as well self-knowledge.

# Roadmap:

Currently,this website is for internal use and is limited to HTML and CSS as technologies. In the future,we would like to enhance this as follows:
- Update information on Preparations page, as food is just one part of preparation, though it is most important.
- Upgrade site for search criteria with the events filtering.
- Add section for live feedback/inputs/suggestions from users.
- Add registration/login possibilities for users from around the world to contribute here
- Add functionality to send event information to registered users.
- Cater the event registration process through this website for events around the world.

# Acknowledgement:

# Quality Checks

I tried to perform thorough testing before deploynig this website. Soome highlights from testing are:

## Testing Areas
- Functional Tests: Verified if all the links are working as expected on all the pages
- GUI Tests: All the information should be accessible, readable at all the pages. Also on different screens, information should be displayed as easily readable.

## Defects
I came accross with various bugs while testing and managed to fix all of them by the end. Some of them are listed here
- Scroll bar was having images with deifferent size -> Rsized each of them to bring all at same size
- Images and respective text was not appearing inline -> Fixed that by dividing screen in rows and columns
- Feedback form submisson was not popping in new tab -> Fixed that with slight change

# Project Status:

In its current status, this website is functioning for the targeted local execution. As well, this is ready for launch on the WWW. High-level enhancements for fututre are metioned in the roadmap, which are not mandatory, of course, but will provide more value to the website.
