# Holi - The festival of colors

This website is the place for information related to one of the most popular Indian festivals, Holi. Here I try to add all relevant information related to this festival for example, what this festival is, why it is celebrated, how one can celebrate it, what preparations are required, where one can join others in this celebration, etc. 

One can find most of the information related to this project by visiting various websites. But couldn't find a single website which can provide complete information related to this. So thought to create a one stop place for such information to make it easier for anyone intersted in it. On this website, I used information 
from various places, including public websites, religious books and as well self-knowledge.

# Roadmap:

Currently,this website is for internal use and is limited to HTML and CSS as technologies. In the future,we would like to enhance this as follows:
- Update information on Preparations page, as food is just one part of preparation, though it is most important.
- Upgrade site for search criteria with the events filtering.
- Add section for live feedback/inputs/suggestions from users.
- Add registration/login possibilities for users from around the world to contribute here
- Add functionality to send event information to registered users.
- Cater the event registration process through this website for events around the world.

# Acknowledgement:

# Project Status:

In its current status, this website is functioning for the targeted local execution. As well, this is ready for launch on the WWW. High-level enhancements for fututre are metioned in the roadmap, which are not mandatory, of course, but will provide more value to the website.
