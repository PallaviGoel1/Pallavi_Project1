				Shrikhand is a dish that is mentioned in the 11th-century book Lokopakara by the Sanskrit scholar Chavundaraya, which covers gardening, medicine, 
				cuisine, and much more. Shrikhand is also mentioned in literature in Mangarasa's 1594 AD manuscript, Supa Shastra: Culinary Traditions in 
				Medieval Karnataka. Shrikhand is a traditional sweet of the Indian subcontinent made from strained yogurt. It is often served as part of a 
				thali or with puris. It is a traditional dessert in Gujarati and Marathi cuisine. The curd (dahi) is partially strained through a cloth to 
				remove the whey and thus produce a solid mass called chakka (the basic ingredient for Shrikhand).

 				The Mughals and their lifestyle left a strong impact on our palates. It was believed that in the 18th century, the Mughal Khansamas prepared 
				this delight in the Mughal kitchens using curd, herbs, and spices to improve digestion. Dahi Bhalla is a sumptuous dish made with curd and 
				some easily available spices and veggies. Yogurt is a slightly sour, thick liquid made by adding bacteria to milk. Here is a simple way to 
				prepare this delectable and healthy recipe: Drain the dal and transfer it to a grinder. Add asafoetida powder, ginger, green chilies, and salt. 
				Grind to a smooth batter and set aside. Dahi means yogurt, and vada means fritters (the fried kind), so the literal translation for these is 
				fritters dunked in yogurt. The base of this dish is vada (fritters) made of Urad dal (split-skinned black-gram lentils).

				This is because the main ingredient, besan, according to various studies, adds protein and fiber to one's diet and helps control cravings as 
				it takes longer to digest than carbohydrates. Chickpea flour, also known as gram flour or besan, is of great importance in Indian cuisine. 
				Try besan flour (which is gluten-free) instead of wheat. This also means that it keeps one fuller for longer. Besan is also rich in potassium, 
				zinc, copper, vitamin B-6, and thiamine. Besan may also help you manage blood glucose levels, facilitate good bowel movements, improve heart 
				health, and offer anticancer properties. These properties of besan have been observed in several ways.

				Somali Roy. Samosa Chaat. This is a dish that, like the act of melting cheese on anything, would have to try very hard to be bad. It's 
				made of a base of chopped-up samosas (savory fried pastries filled with spicy potatoes and peas) and topped with chutney, yogurt, and 
				sev (those thin fried potato bits). A small triangular pastry filled with spiced meat or vegetables and fried in ghee or oil. In short, 
				samosa chaat is made when samosa is broken into bite-sized pieces and served with masala, chutney, and spices. Even though it's amazing 
				street food, it can also be made at home.
