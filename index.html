			<h3>
				Holi, one of the most popular Hindu festivals, has been celebrated since ancient times on the day of Phalgun Purnima (as per the Hindu calendar). 
				The Holi Festival is celebrated as a way to welcome the spring season, a way to celebrate the victory of good, and also as a new beginning where 
				people can release all their inhibitions and start fresh. It is said that during the Holi Festival, God turns a blind eye, and it's one of the 
				few times extremely devout Hindus allow themselves to let loose. They open up and enjoy each otherâ€™s company, take time to dance and party, 
				and throw their cultural norms to the side. 
				<br>			
				<br>
				On the first day of the festival, a bonfire is lit to symbolically burn away all the bad and give way to a colorful and vibrant new future. 
				And the second starts with throwing colored powder dye into the air, covering all in attendance with vibrant colors. In a religious sense, 
				the colors are rich with symbolism and have multiple meanings: they can mean a vibrant new life and even represent sin in a way. For some, 
				washing off the dye at the end of the day can mean a new commitment to live well, as well as cleansing oneself of evil and demons.
