			<h3>Holi, one of the most popular Hindu festival, is being celebrated since ancient times on the day of Phalgun Purnima (as per Hindu calendar). The Holi Festival is 
			celebrated as a way to welcome Spring season, way to celebrate victory of good and also is seen as a new beginning where people can release all their inhibitions and 
			start fresh. It is said that during the Holi Festival, God turns a blind eye, and it’s one of the few times extremely devout Hindus allow themselves to let loose. They 
			open up and enjoy each other’s company, take time to dance and party, and throw their cultural norms to the side. 
				<br>			
				<br>
			On the first day of the festival, a bonfire is lit to symbolically burn away all the bad and give way to a colorful and vibrant new future. And the second starts 
			with throwing colored powder dye into the air, covering all in attendance with vibrant colors. In a religious sense, the colors are rich with symbolism and have 
			multiple meanings: they can mean a vibrant new life and even represent sin in a way. For some, washing off the dye at the end of the day can mean new commitment 
			to live well, as cleansing oneself of evils and demons.</h3>
